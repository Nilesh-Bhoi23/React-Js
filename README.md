1) My First React Code:- React application are built using Components , which are reusable and Self-contained pieces of UI. Components can be either functional or class-based              
<br>
  
2) Props and JSX:-                         
   Props :- Props(short for "properties") are read-only inputs that are passed to Components.they allow you to pass data and event handlers to Child Components.
   JSX:- JSX is a syntax extension that looks similar to HTML and is used to describe the UI. It makes it easier to write and visualize the structure of your components.
4) Hooks & State in React                 
  Hooks:- Hooks are special functions that let you "hook into" React's state and lifecycle features from functional components.
5) useEffect                               <br>
6) useRef()                               <br>
