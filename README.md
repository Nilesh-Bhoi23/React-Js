<br>
  <hr>
2) Props and JSX:-                         
   Props :- Props(short for "properties") are read-only inputs that are passed to Components.they allow you to pass data and event handlers to Child Components.
   JSX:- JSX is a syntax extension that looks similar to HTML and is used to describe the UI. It makes it easier to write and visualize the structure of your components.<br>
3) Hooks & State in React                 
  Hooks:- Hooks are special functions that let you "hook into" React's state and lifecycle features from functional components.
  State :- State is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves. it is mutable and can e changed over time .triggering a re-render of the component.

4) useEffect() :- Handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually updating the DOM.                               <br>

5) useRef() :-  useRef is a React hook that returns a mutable ref object. This object has a single property, current, which can be initialized with a value (or null by default).
                               <br>
6) Conditional Rendering & Rendering Lists in React <br>

7) EventHandling:- An event in programming, particularly in JavaScript and React, refers to an action or occurrence that takes place in the browser or application that can be detected and responded to. Events are typically triggered by user interactions such as: <br>

Clicking a button <br>
Typing on the keyboard <br>
Hovering over an element <br>
