1) My First React Code:- React application are built using Components , which are reusable and Self-contained pieces of UI. Components can be either functional or class-based              
<br>
  
2) Props and JSX:-                         
   Props :- Props(short for "properties") are read-only inputs that are passed to Components.they allow you to pass data and event handlers to Child Components.
